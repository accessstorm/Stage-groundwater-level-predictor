This Google colab Notebook facilitates data analysis and machine learning tasks. 
It begins with dataset uploading via Google Colab and imports popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. 
The primary focus is on implementing a RandomForestRegressor model for predictive analysis. 
Data is preprocessed using tools like StandardScaler for normalization. The notebook also includes training, testing, and performance evaluation using metrics like mean squared error and R² score. 
Visualizations are generated with matplotlib and seaborn for insights. 
It’s tailored for predictive modeling and exploration in Python, streamlining workflow with a structured approach. ​
